Personal Blog Application 
## The Main purpose to Build this project ðŸ“Œ
My main objective in building this Angular application is to apply and deepen my knowledge of the Angular framework, 
including components, directives, pipes, forms, routing, guards, and services.
Additionally, I aim to enhance my skills in asynchronous programming using the RxJS library.
For backend and authentication, I am leveraging Firebase to implement both authentication and authorization functionalities, 
with the goal of deploying the application on a free platform.
